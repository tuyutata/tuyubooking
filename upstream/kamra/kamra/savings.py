"""The savings ledger — Kamra's core product primitive.

Every meaningful action (human or agent) can be recorded as an
Agent Action Log row. Automated actions carry an estimate of the staff
minutes they avoided; the dashboard aggregates these into the
hours-saved counter that anchors Kamra's value story.

As of v23 (autonomy gate), each row also carries an approval_status
(Executed / Suggested / Pending / Approved / Rejected) and optional
before/after JSON snapshots so the Agents Inbox can render a diff and
the timeline can support undo.

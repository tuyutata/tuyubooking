"""Fix three v1 mistakes:

1. Reservation booking fields (booking_type, company, …) were inserted
   into DocType.fields as raw DocField docs and silently dropped —
   re-add them properly with dt.append().
2. Custom DocPerm rows REPLACE a doctype's built-in permissions in
   Frappe, so seeding role perms locked System Manager out. Grant
   System Manager full custom perms on every Kamra doctype, and give
   Front Desk / Finance their missing folio-era grants.
3. The same trap, one layer deeper: seed_rbac_v2.ensure_agent_user()
   writes Custom DocPerms for Kamra Agent, and the moment ONE lands the
   doctype's whole standard permission block stops applying — silently
   revoking Front Desk, Finance, Revenue Manager and Housekeeping on
   every doctype it touched. Symptom: "Insufficient Permission" for a
   Front Desk user on Reservation/Guest/Room/Property/Folio, while the
   SPA mostly keeps working because Kamra's whitelisted endpoints go
   through require_roles and db.set_value, which never consult doctype
   perms at all (see authz.py). sync_standard_perms() repairs it.

	silently revokes every other role - which is exactly what happened here.

	The repair is deliberately data-driven. The doctype JSONs in this repo are
	the source of truth and already declare every role correctly; this copies
	whatever they say into Custom DocPerm for any role that is missing. No
	hardcoded role list, so it cannot drift from the JSONs and it stays right
	when a new doctype or role is added - just re-run it.

	Only touches doctypes that ALREADY have Custom DocPerm rows: adding rows
	to a clean doctype would switch off its standard perms and create the very
	bug this fixes. Never overwrites an existing custom row, so deliberate
	overrides (System Manager's full grant above) survive.

"""Malaysia localization pack.

Malaysian accommodation is under SST (Service Tax), not GST (repealed
2018). Since 1 March 2024 accommodation is taxed at 8%, while food &
beverage stayed at 6% - the one country in the seam where rooms and
restaurants genuinely carry different rates:

  - the room rate comes from the Room Type's tax percent (default 8),
    so a future rate change is typed on the room type
  - hotel F&B is fixed at the statutory 6% F&B service tax rate
  - the Tourism Tax (TTx, RM10 per room per night, foreign guests
    only, operators under MyTTx) is a flat per-night levy, not a
    percentage - post it as a folio charge line for foreign-guest
    stays; automating it needs nationality-aware night audit, which a
    later pack version can add
  - invoices quote the SST registration number

MyTTx / SST-02 return filing is out of scope for the pack - a
connected service can wire it later without touching this seam.

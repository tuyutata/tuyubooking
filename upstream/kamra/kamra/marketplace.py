"""The Kamra Marketplace: what's in your plan, and what you can plug in.

Three kinds of card, three install models - never conflated:

  module     a Kamra app that ships in this codebase, open and included
             (no install, no lock).
  connector  a live integration backed by a config row (a channel, a payment
             gateway, an AI key) - the card connects/configures it here.
  bench_app  a separate Frappe app you install on the bench (country packs,
             the ERPNext accounting bridge) - the card shows honest
             `bench get-app` instructions, never a fake button.

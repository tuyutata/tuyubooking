"""Backfill approval_status on pre-v23 Agent Action Log rows.

Before the autonomy gate landed, every logged action was a fait accompli —
the row was written after the tool ran. In the new model, approval_status
distinguishes: Executed (ran under Full autonomy), Suggested (draft only),
Pending / Approved / Rejected (gated actions). All historical rows are
retroactively 'Executed' — that's what the old log_action() actually recorded.

executed_at is backfilled from `creation` since the two were the same event
before the gate existed.

"""Kitchen stock: what a dish consumes, and what the outlet has left.

Three ideas hold this module together. Each looks like a bug until you know
why it is there, so each is spelled out where it lives:

1. HEAT IS IRREVERSIBLE. Ingredients leave the shelf when the chef starts
   cooking (fire_kot), not when the bill is paid. Nothing downstream ever
   puts them back - not a void, not a cancel, not a recall. A line voided
   after firing was cooked and binned: that is wastage, not a reversal.
   See the reversal table in consume_for_lines().

2. A SHORT COUNT NEVER BLOCKS SERVICE. If the numbers say the paneer ran
   out, the chef still has paneer in their hand and the ticket still fires.
   The balance goes negative and says so loudly. Negative means "this count
   is stale, go recount" - it is the module admitting it does not know
   something, which is the most useful thing it can do. Do NOT clamp it.

3. THE RECIPE IS A LIE, BY 5-15%. A chef's hand is not a scale. Theoretical
   consumption always drifts from actual, which is exactly why adjust_stock()
   and last_counted_at exist. The honest claim is "here is what you SHOULD
   have; go count and tell me what you DO."

Permissions: consume_for_lines() runs under a captain's session, which cannot
write Ingredient Stock or Stock Ledger Entry by design - only Finance can move
stock deliberately. The writes in _apply_move() therefore use
ignore_permissions / db.set_value. That is intentional, not an oversight: the
authorization for consumption is the POS_ROLES gate on fire_kot, not doctype
perms on the ledger. authz.py's own docstring makes the same point.

	Idempotent per line via stock_posted, so a re-fired later course, a
	recall, a split or a retried request can never double-deduct.

	WHY AN EXPLICIT CALL, NOT A CONTROLLER HOOK: POS Order.on_update +
	posted_to_folio is the right template for folio posting, and the wrong one
	for stock. split_order() inserts a NEW POS Order whose lines are copied
	with kot_status intact - brand-new child rows that are already "Fired"
	with stock_posted defaulting to 0. A hook keyed on "fired and not posted"
	would silently deduct twice for every split bill. Splitting a table is
	routine, so the data would be poisoned within a week and be near
	impossible to trace back. (split_order copies stock_posted across too,
	which closes the same hole from the other side.)

	WHAT DOES *NOT* MOVE STOCK, and why - the whole reversal table:
	  create_order / add_items  nothing left the shelf; a tab may sit an hour
	  void on a New line        never deducted
	  void on a Fired line      the chef may be cooking it RIGHT NOW. It is
	                            cooked and binned: wastage, not a reversal.
	  acknowledge_void          display only, no physical meaning
	  recall_prepared           Prepared -> Fired, never -> New. A mis-tap on
	                            a greasy screen must not move stock.
	  mark_prepared             ingredients left at fire, not here
	  cancel_order              fired half was cooked; unfired half never moved
	  deliver_order / pay_order money-time, far too late
	  mark_nc                   a comped dish consumed real paneer - that is
	                            the entire point of costing an NC
	  a recipe edited later     the ledger snapshotted qty at fire; history is
	                            never rewritten
	The genuinely-not-cooked case (a captain voids five seconds after firing,
	before the chef looked up) is NOT solved with a heuristic on void_seen or
	elapsed time - that guesses at the physical world and is wrong in both
	directions. It is solved by adjust_stock: a human puts it back, with a
	required note, leaving a Count row. A discrepancy is an explicit decision,
	never silence - the same shape as laundry's shortage guard.

"""The banquet function sheet.

A Venue Booking is one function from first phone call to final bill:
enquiry -> tentative hold -> confirmed -> completed. Everything the
customer is buying lives in `items` - the hall itself, the menu packages,
the AV, the decor, the DJ, the accommodation - and each line says whether
it is chargeable or complimentary. Complimentary lines still print on the
event order and the pack list (someone has to carry the podium either
way); they just don't reach the quote.

Money is settled here, not by the caller: qty for per-pax lines follows
the guaranteed/actual pax rule, per-hour lines follow the function's own
hours, the negotiated discount is spread pro-rata so every line keeps its
own GST rate, and tax falls back to the rate for that kind of item rather
than whatever a caller happened to pass.

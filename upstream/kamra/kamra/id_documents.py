"""Guest ID scans - the only place in Kamra that writes a private file.

Two callers, one gate: the guest's token-gated self check-in
(public_api.precheckin_upload_id) and the desk's authenticated counter
capture (api.upload_id_document). Both land in the same shape, so retention
only ever has to know about one shape.

Three things here are deliberate and will look wrong to someone skimming:

1. is_private=1 IS A LITERAL, never a parameter. Frappe's own upload_file
   takes is_private from the client form_dict - i.e. it trusts the browser to
   protect an Aadhaar scan. Nothing in this module can be talked into writing
   an ID where the public web can read it, because there is no argument that
   would do it.

2. THE FILE HANGS OFF THE RESERVATION, NOT THE GUEST. Guest is a shared
   profile keyed by phone, reused across stays. If the scan lived there,
   checkout of one stay would delete a document a repeat guest's OTHER live
   stay still needs. (_scrub_stay_ids already has that bug for the id_number
   TEXT - tolerable, the desk retypes it. For a file it is irreversible.)
   Attaching per-reservation makes cross-stay safety structural.

3. RE-ENCODING IS THE SECURITY BOUNDARY, not the format check. See _sanitise.

The image is deleted at checkout under the property's "Verify & Discard"
retention (see discard_id_document, called from api._scrub_stay_ids). Note
for anyone reading this before an audit: `bench backup --with-files` tars
private/files, so a scan survives in backups after that delete. No code here
fixes that; it is a backup-rotation decision. Do not let the guest-facing
copy over-promise.

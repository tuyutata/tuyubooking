## Why we built this

Most hotel PMS software was built twenty years ago and has barely moved since. Dozens of options, almost no innovation: the same click-heavy screens, the same nightly rituals, the same walls around your own data.

Hotels deserve better than:

- **Per-room, per-module rent.** Your software bill grows every time your hotel does. Night audit is an add-on. Reports are an add-on. The booking engine is an add-on.
- **Your data held hostage.** Guest history, rate history, your books — locked in a vendor's cloud, with an export fee if you ever try to leave.
- **Waiting for AI that never ships.** Legacy vendors bolt a chatbot onto 2005-era software and call it innovation. Real agentic operations need a system *designed* to be operated by AI, not just chatted at.
- **Integration purgatory.** Every connection is a paid interface, a certification queue, a quarter of waiting.
- **Trained-staff-only software.** If a new hire needs a week of training to check someone in, the software failed — not the hire.

**Kamra is the answer we wanted to exist:** a full property management system where every operation — booking, check-in, folios, night audit, pricing — is a governed action, exposed over a real tool layer, so *you* can bring the AI you trust to run it.

## What makes Kamra different

- **Agent-ready, not agent-locked.** Kamra ships an [MCP server](mcp/kamra_mcp.py) with governed tools, role-scoped and permission-checked like any user. Connect Claude (or any MCP client) and say *"book Mr. Rao a deluxe for the weekend with breakfast"* — it quotes, books, and every action is logged. No bundled agent personas to trust or configure — bring your own.
- **Bring your own key.** No bundled AI markup, no model lock-in. Point your own LLM at Kamra's tool surface, or connect [HeyKoala](https://heykoala.ai) for a phone/WhatsApp AI concierge.
- **Deterministic money.** Prices, taxes, availability come from a pricing engine — never from a language model. GST slabs, multi-rate invoices, and the no-overbooking guard are code, verified by an eval suite in CI.
- **Full audit trail.** Every action — human or AI — is logged with who did it, what changed, and why. Accountability comes from the ledger, not from hoping the model behaves.
- **Truly free.** AGPL-licensed. No per-room pricing, no per-user seats, no license audits, no "premium" tiers. Self-host on-prem or on any cloud.
- **Built on Frappe.** The framework behind ERPNext — one of the world's largest open-source ERPs — with its mature ecosystem: RBAC, audit trails, multi-tenancy, the frappe/payments gateway app, and a huge developer community.

## Short-term rentals (2.5)

Kamra now runs villas and multi-site STR portfolios the same way it runs
hotels — one property, several physical addresses, room-wise or entire-place
selling, deposits and credit notes, and a guest-facing catalog that looks like
a listing site rather than a hotel room grid.

Pick **Short Term Rental** when you create the property (or later in Settings).
The booking engine then shows a villa catalog, per-site maps, a real
check-in / check-out date range, and a **Check availability** button.

| | |
|---|---|
| ![STR catalog — villas, date range, Check availability](docs/screenshots/str-catalog.png) | ![Two villas on one booking page](docs/screenshots/str-villas.png) |
| **Catalog** — check-in and check-out, guest counts, and Check availability | **Places to stay** — each villa is its own card, with its own address and from-rate |

[![Villa listing with rooms, dates and caretaker](docs/screenshots/str-listing.png)](https://ewa.kamrapms.com/kamra/book)

**Villa page** — pick a room or the whole house, live stay totals, check-in / check-out, Check availability, and a caretaker number guests can tap.

Live example: [ewa.kamrapms.com/book](https://ewa.kamrapms.com/kamra/book) (Ewa Reserve — WaterFront in Mangaluru and Tatasth in Kundapur).

each guide.

### REST API

Kamra exposes **178 REST endpoints** — the same governed layer the UI and
the AI use:

- **[REST API reference](https://kamrapms.com/docs/api-reference)** —
  every endpoint with method, required roles, parameters and description,
  generated from the source so it never drifts
- **[Postman collection](https://kamrapms.com/docs/kamra.postman_collection.json)**
  — import it, set `base_url` (your Kamra URL), `api_key` and `api_secret`
  collection variables, and every request is ready to try
- [MCP tool reference](https://kamrapms.com/docs/mcp-tools) — the 32 tools
  AI agents get

```bash
# the calling convention
curl -X POST https://<your-kamra>/api/method/kamra.api.get_quote \
  -H "Authorization: token <api_key>:<api_secret>" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"property":"Your Property","room_type":"Your Property-DLX",
       "check_in_date":"2026-08-01","check_out_date":"2026-08-03"}'
```

## Install

```bash
bench get-app payments
bench get-app kamra https://github.com/Kamra-PMS/kamra-pms --branch main
bench --site your-site install-app kamra
```

Kamra ships its built front-end, so after install the product UI is live at
**`/kamra`** (the booking engine redirects in at `/book`, housekeeping at
`/hk`) — no Node server in production. The Frappe Desk stays available at
`/app` as an admin escape hatch. A fresh install creates its own roles and
permissions; sign in as your Administrator and open `/kamra/setup` to create
your property, then add staff users.

### Compatibility & channels

| Kamra | Frappe | Channel |
|---|---|---|
| `main` releases (`vX.Y.Z`) | v16 | **stable** — Frappe Cloud Marketplace, `ghcr.io/kamra-pms/kamra:latest`, [demo.kamrapms.com](https://demo.kamrapms.com) |
| `develop` | v16 | **nightly** — `ghcr.io/kamra-pms/kamra:nightly`, rebuilt every night |

`develop` is the repo's default branch (for contributors), so production
installs should keep the explicit `--branch main`. Releases follow
[SemVer](https://semver.org/); see [`RELEASING.md`](RELEASING.md).

## Quickstart (development)

```bash
bench init --frappe-branch v16.25.0 frappe-bench && cd frappe-bench
bench get-app payments
bench get-app kamra https://github.com/Kamra-PMS/kamra-pms
bench new-site kamra.localhost --admin-password admin
bench --site kamra.localhost install-app kamra
bench serve --port 8000
cd apps/kamra/frontend && npm install && npm run dev   # hot-reload UI on :5173
```

Rebuild the production UI after front-end changes with `npm run build` at the
app root (emits into `kamra/public/frontend`, served at `/kamra`). Seed a demo
property, roles and users via `bench --site … execute kamra.scripts.seed_demo.execute`
(this also enables the demo-account buttons on the login screen). Full dev
notes: [docs-dev.md](docs-dev.md).

Connect an AI agent:

```bash
claude mcp add kamra -e KAMRA_URL=... -e KAMRA_API_KEY=... \
  -e KAMRA_API_SECRET=... -- python mcp/kamra_mcp.py
```

## For hotel owners

You own the software, the server, and every byte of your data. Costs don't scale with your room count. Connect your own AI and it works from day one — and if you ever want managed hosting or an AI concierge (voice, WhatsApp) on top, those are choices, not ransoms.

## For IT teams

Standard Python (Frappe) + React. Real RBAC, real audit trails, documented REST + MCP surfaces, an eval suite in CI, no black boxes. Fork it, extend it, ship your own modules — that's the point.

## License

AGPL-3.0 — free forever. Anyone offering Kamra as a hosted service must share their modifications back, which keeps the ecosystem honest.

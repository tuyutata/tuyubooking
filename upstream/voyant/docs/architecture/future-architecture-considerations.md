# Voyant Future Architecture Considerations

This document tracks architecture ideas that are worth keeping visible, but
that should stay out of the active cleanup and execution backlog for now.

The goal is simple:

- capture promising future work without treating it as current scope
- keep later-stage ideas visible and reviewable
- avoid bloating the active architecture surface before the basics are settled

These are not rejected ideas. They are deferred ideas.

For the disciplined review order and the "first real slice" to take when one of
these items becomes justified, see
[`future-architecture-review-plan.md`](./future-architecture-review-plan.md).

## Deferral Rules

An item belongs here when:

- it solves a real future problem but not an urgent current one
- the current framework can stay simpler without it
- it depends on runtime or scale assumptions that are not settled yet
- it would add meaningful surface area before the simpler baseline is fully in
  place

Rule:

If an idea is plausible but not yet necessary, track it here instead of turning
it into an active architecture requirement.

## Promoted Since Drafting

The following items have moved into active architecture guidance:

- advanced constraint and index policy
  see [`data-model-schema-authoring.md`](./data-model-schema-authoring.md) and
  [`index-and-constraint-policy.md`](./index-and-constraint-policy.md)
- locking and concurrency control policy
  see [`locking-and-concurrency-policy.md`](./locking-and-concurrency-policy.md)
- event delivery and durable execution policy
  see
  [`event-delivery-and-durable-execution-policy.md`](./event-delivery-and-durable-execution-policy.md)
- token signing and key distribution policy
  see
  [`token-signing-and-key-distribution-policy.md`](./token-signing-and-key-distribution-policy.md)
- link metadata and relationship policy
  see
  [`link-metadata-and-relationship-policy.md`](./link-metadata-and-relationship-policy.md)
- cross-module indexing and projection policy
  see
  [`cross-module-indexing-and-projection-policy.md`](./cross-module-indexing-and-projection-policy.md)

## Deferred Areas

There are currently no deferred architecture items in the active review set.

Future additions should only be added here when they meet the deferral rules
above and are not yet justified as active guidance.

## Review Guidance

When revisiting an item from this document, ask:

1. Is the current simpler model now causing real friction?
2. Do we have concrete workload or product evidence for the change?
3. Can the new primitive stay narrow instead of becoming a framework-wide
   abstraction leak?

If the answer is yes, the item may be ready to move into the active backlog.

## Non-Goals

This document is not:

- a roadmap commitment
- a promise that every item here will be built
- a dump for vague ideas with no architectural reason

The purpose is disciplined deferral, not an architecture wish list.
